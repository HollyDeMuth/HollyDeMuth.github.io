                <p> According to NYC Open Data, complaints to the city about asbestos spiked 77% in the Rockaways this year. This is especially striking in light of the fact that the asbestos complaint rate went down in the city overall, by 39%. Such a dramatic increase seemed to indicate an alarming trend. A closer look at the numbers, though, revealed something else. Of the 74 total complaints in the community district so far this year, 45 were about the same building – and 40 of those complaints were filed on the same day. </p>

<p> The building is a former warehouse at 226 Beach 101st Street, and it is currently under construction to be converted into a homeless shelter. The shelter, purported to house 120 single individuals, is being overseen by local developer Liberty One Group. Besides the asbestos complaints, there have been over 100 complaints filed about the building this year, according to the New York City Department of Buildings. Locally, the shelter has become a hot button point of controversy.</p>

 <p> “When they announced this, you’re thinking how can they imagine after what everybody went through in this peninsula, that they would put this shelter here?” said Torey Schnupp, a local resident. “Property values finally go back up and now they’re getting slammed with this.” </p> </div>

                    Schnupp is a founding member of Rockaway Solutions Not Shelters, a group formed by locals earlier this year with the stated intention of stopping the shelter from opening. The group’s private Facebook page currently has 531 members. Leaders of the group frequently post on local public Facebook pages urging collective action against the shelter. Posters say they worry that shelter residents will be sexual predators or struggle with drug addiction or mental illness. In late April, right before the bulk of the asbestos complaints were filed, Schnupp and other members of her organization posted repeatedly on Facebook urging locals to complain about the shelter to the city.

                    Schnupp cited concern about local children as a motivation for her fight against the shelter, noting that the building is near several schools. “The kids aren’t considered when these places are sited,” she said. “This is where kids walk to get to their buses.”  </p>

                  According to the New York Department of Homeless Services, homelessness in the city has risen sharply in the last decade. In September of this year, an average of 62,391 people slept in New York City shelters each night. That number is up 59% from ten years ago, according to Coalition for the Homeless, a local homeless advocacy organization.

                  Schnupp said that her organization is not against helping homeless people. She insisted that the shelter on Beach 101 will not actually help the homeless, calling it “a half assed solution.” She described plans she had seen for the shelter that would divide it into nine dorms, with 13 men per room. Noting that it was once a warehouse, she said, “You’re literally warehousing human beings.” She scoffed at city data that showed an increase in homelessness in the area, saying that the Department of Human Services must be skewing the numbers. “They’re an agency who don’t have to explain themselves for any reason to anybody,” she said. DHS did not return calls for comment.

                  While Solutions Not Shelters has contended that the community is already overburdened, Community District 14 is far from having the greatest number of shelters in Queens. With three shelters currently operating, Rockaway falls far behind Jamaica, which hosts 22 shelters. In fact, most districts in Queens have more shelters than the Rockaways, and the areas with the city’s highest number of shelters are in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

                  For her part, Schnupp doesn’t seem interested in giving up her battle with the city. She is planning a rally of local elementary and high school students outside the shelter later this month. She says it’s a matter of student safety, but it’s also about the money the city spends on such shelters. “It would be nice if our kids had access to these funds for educational purposes, rather than homeless people,” said Schnupp.
